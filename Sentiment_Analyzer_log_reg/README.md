The Objective of this project is to use NLP techniques and to train a Machine Learning model to predict the sentiment of Review (Positive or Negative).I used IMDB Reviews dataset of 10,000 samples. Performed Data cleaning, Lemmatization using nltk, tokenization and vectorization using Count vectorizer, TF-IDF Vectorizer. I used Machine Learning models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and AdaBoost classifiers for model training. Achieved a precision score of 0.918, AUC score of 0.973, and F1 score of 0.917 on the test dataset with the Logistic Regression model. Explained the marginal performance of the model using Explainable AI packages like SHAP. Developed a sentiment analysis web application using Flask API and Learned deployment of the model on AWS Cloud.
