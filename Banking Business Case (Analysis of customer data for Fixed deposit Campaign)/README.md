I Calculated the percentage of customers with a loan who have taken out insurance. I did Visualization on  this data and discussed its potential implications.
I Analysed and summarized the best Contact method (with the highest success percentage) to contact people to ascertain the status of term deposit subscriptions. I determined which age group has the highest percentage of home loans.
I Investigated any relationships between annual income and age group. 
I used correlation matrix and chi square test to find relationship between various features. 
I used one hot encoding to convert categorical data to numerical data. 
I had used Logistic Regression, Random Forest and GRADIENT Boosting  to train the dataset. Among all the algorithms Gradient boosting Classifier performs best on the validation data with an accuracy score of 90.7%.
