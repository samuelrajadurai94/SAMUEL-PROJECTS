Here, I used Machine Learning Algorithms to predict whether candidate profile is suitable for loan approval or not from the given features like Education, Dependants, Applicant Income, Credit History, etc.I did Data Cleaning, Preprocessing and visualization on given dataset. I had used various ML models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVC, Gradient Boosting model to train  the dataset. Among all the algorithms Random Forest Classifier performs best on the validation data with an accuracy score of 78.03%. Hypertuned the Random forest classifier by using randomsearchcv and improved the Accuracy score from 78.03% to 80.18%. Concluded that Random Forest Classifier is giving the best accuracy with an accuracy score of 80%  for the testing dataset.
