The aim of this project is to detect whether a worker is wearing all the safety PPEs in the videos or images. This can be used in intelligent surveillance systems for monitoring safety of construction workers. I used Construction site Image dataset. It contains 2600 train, 100 validation, 80 test images. I did EDA on the CSS dataset. After EDA, I tried to visualize the samples in all the splits (train/valid/test). I used YoloV8L model from ULTRALYTICS to train our custom object detection model. I take the best weights after 100 epochs of Training. Performed detection on sample Images and Videos. Visualized performance metrics of custom trained model.  our model achieved Mean Average Precision score of 0.80 for 50% IOU threshold at 100th epoch which is a good score indicating that model is performing well. It indicates that the model is able to identify positive samples with high precision and high recall.
